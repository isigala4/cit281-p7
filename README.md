Overview

Creating either an organization-level or user-level GitHub Page, and adding content to this Page. This Page will be the entry web page for your portfolio.

Creating repos for each of the labs and projects for the CIT 281 class

Creating a GitHub Page for each of the labs and projects that provides a brief description of the lab or project, and a screen capture

Adding links to the organization or user Page to each of the labs and projects
